# ShadeJS Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to ShadeJS. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from `develop`, and open pull requests against that branch. Develop is used as the staging branch for the next release. A release will be generated after merging develop -> main.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR.

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention](./COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).
- Ensure that the documentation [site](./.vitepress/config.ts) is updated to reflect your changes in the pull request.

## Development Setup

You can view the main [README](../README.md) for setup instructions
